# E-Vote
A voting app made possible with GUN.js

# Gun Js 
[GunJs](https://gun.eco/) is a small, easy, and fast protocol for syncing data across many peers. And this is not achived by some central server but through multiple peer nodes running in a decentralized fashion. 

# The Idea 
Users are able to login with their user id and loing and then they are able to cast their votes. The accumulated votes are then synched up using gun which can be accesed though a moderator. <br>
This way the results are calculated in a perfect and secure way!

> This project concept won first place at the Incepto Hackathon held at College of Enginnering Perumon
